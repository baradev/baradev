### üëã Hi!

I'm **[Barbora Klusackova](https://barbora-portfolio.vercel.app/)**,

a Software Developer @[Volition](https://www.volition.org.nz/).

I'm also an AWS enthusiast and community builder, and I co-organize the [Auckland AWS Tools & Programming Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/auckland-aws-tools-meetup/?eventOrigin=home_groups_you_organize). ‚òÅÔ∏è

*During the last year, I've worked on a range of projects, many of which are open-source. If any of these projects interest you, please feel free to take a look at the code and suggest any improvements or enhancements you think could be made. Collaborating with others is a valuable way to learn and grow, and I'm always open to new ideas and feedback.*
